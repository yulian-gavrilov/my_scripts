# my_scripts

Here I collected some of my scripts written in Python, Shell, Matlab, Perl and C.
The scripts help to sole different tasks in the field of computational  protein biophysics. 
Also
ABSURDer app (https://github.com/KULL-Centre/ABSURDer). 
It is not my app but I am a coauthor of the related publication and very much familiar with it. 
I use it as a reference for my own work.
